<h2>DiSC Trainer Certification &ndash; In Company Course</h2>
<p>An in-company certification is typically less expensive per head than our publicly-scheduled courses.</p>
<p>If you have a team of people looking to become accredited, but want to avoid the high cost of people being away from the office, it may be more beneficial for us to come to you and run an in-house certification.</p>
<p>Not only may it be more financially beneficial (depending on the number of attendees), but the training can be adapted and made more specific to your organisational needs.&nbsp;</p>
