<p><strong>The S style tends to prioritise giving support, maintaining stability and enjoying collaboration</strong></p> 

<p>You’ll notice calmness and patience with people high in the Steadiness quadrant. They are cooperative and friendly, although because they are more subdued, their friendliness is more low-key than the effervescence of the “i” dimension. You may need to pay closer attention to their mannerisms to see their friendliness, until you get to know them. </p>
<p>Persistence is another one of their strengths.</p>

<p><strong>Priorities:</strong> giving support, maintaining stability, enjoying collaboration </p>

<p><strong>Motivated by:</strong> stable environments, sincere appreciation, cooperation, opportunities to help </p>

<p><strong>Fears:</strong> loss of stability, change, loss of harmony, offending others </p>

<p><strong>You will notice:</strong> patience, team player, calm approach, good listener, humility </p>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> overly accommodating, tendency to avoid change, indecisiveness </p>

<p>To communicate effectively with “S” style individuals, arrange for a secure environment (their office or some other familiar place). Be logical and systematic in your approach and if your message involves any type of change, tell them about it early on and let them adapt to it slowly. Emphasise their importance and show sincere appreciation.</p>

<p>The Golden Rule: be Steady, be Supportive, be Sincere!</p>
