<h2>Introducing Everything <span class="DISC-In-Headers">DiSC</span> 363<span class="Superscript">&reg;</span> for Leaders: a new kind of 360!</h2>
<p>Finally, a 360 for DiSC<span class="Superscript">&reg;</span> users! But <em>Everything DiSC 363<span class="Superscript">&reg;</span> for Leaders</em> isn't just any 360. It combines the best of 360s with the simplicity and power of DiSC, plus three personalised strategies for improving leadership effectiveness. The result is a 360&deg; experience that's more productive and satisfying.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>So how is 363 different?</h2>
<h4>First, we took the sting out of 360 feedback.</h4>
<p>For many leaders, 360s can be a frustrating experience. Open-ended comments can be unfocused and unhelpful and can even derail the learning process. With our exclusive selectable comments feature, CommentSmart, raters can give focused, balanced, constructive feedback&mdash;that the leader can actually use.</p>
<h4>Then, we made it easier to understand and use.</h4>
<p><em> Everything DiSC 363 for Leaders</em> isn&rsquo;t a collection of dry spreadsheets and charts without any explanation or story. Clear visuals and a conversational narrative style interpret and explain the data, making the report easy to understand and use.</p>
<p>Leaders can quickly learn to navigate the Everything DiSC&reg; Leadership model, a circumplex that describes eight approaches to effective leadership:&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Pioneering</td>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Humble</td>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Energizing</td>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deliberate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Affirming</td>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resolute&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inclusive</td>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commanding</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the eight components&nbsp;<strong>contribute to leadership success</strong>; while you don&rsquo;t need to excel in every area, you need at least some level of competency in each to be an effective leader.&nbsp;Leaders are most likely to have strengths in areas that reflect their own styles; so understanding yourself better is the first step to becoming more effective when leading others.</p>
<h4>And finally, we answered the &ldquo;Now what?&rdquo;</h4>
<p>With a lot of 360s, the leader's response can be, &ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; <em>Everything DiSC 363 for Leaders</em> answers that question by giving leaders their next steps with three things they can focus on now.&nbsp;</p>
