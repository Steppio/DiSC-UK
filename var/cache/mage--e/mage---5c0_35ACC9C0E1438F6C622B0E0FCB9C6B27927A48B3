<h1>HOW DOES THE EPIC CREDIT SYSTEM WORK?</h1>
<p>EPIC works on a credit system. You purchase credits for your EPIC Account and they become the currency used to pay for profiles.</p>
<p>To understand the EPIC credit system, think of it like a gift voucher. You can decide what you want to buy and in what combination up to the sum of the voucher. The EPIC system works in much the same way. Each profile has a credit value and you purchase the number of credits you need for the profiles you plan to use.</p>
<p>EPIC Credits can be used for any report at any time and they never expire. You can lower your profile costs by purchasing credits in quantities, receive them into your account electronically and “bank” them to use with any profiles you generate in the future.</p>
