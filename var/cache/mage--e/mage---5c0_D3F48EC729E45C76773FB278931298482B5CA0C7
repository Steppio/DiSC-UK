<p><strong>The D style tends to prioritise getting immediate results, taking action and challenging themselves and others</strong></p>

<p>You will recognise people who are high in Dominance quadrant by their high self-confidence, assertiveness, goal orientation, competitiveness, and high sense of urgency. This is not to say other styles aren’t competitive, just that people high in the D dimension tend to show their competitiveness outwardly, to the extent of being verbally competitive, and enjoying getting into debates or arguments.</p>

<p><strong>Priorities:</strong> getting immediate results, taking action, challenging self and others</p>

<p><strong>Motivated by:</strong> power and authority, competition, winning, success</p>

<p><strong>Fears:</strong> loss of control, being taken advantage of, vulnerability</p>

<p>When communicating with “D” style individuals, give them the bottom line, be brief, focus your discussion narrowly, avoid making generalisations, refrain from repeating yourself, and focus on solutions rather than problems.

<p>The Golden Rule: be Brief, be Bright, be Gone!</p>
